## Release Notes

### Version 2.0.0 - "Comic Combiner Edition"

This major release transforms Comic Cruncher from a single-purpose compression tool into a comprehensive comic processing suite. The addition of Comic Combiner mode provides a complete solution for both optimizing individual comics and creating organized TPB collections.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Dual functionality**: One application handles both compression and collection creation
- **Intelligent automation**: Auto-detects series patterns and creates properly named TPBs
- **Enhanced performance**: Improved batch processing with better resource management
- **Professional interface**: Modern toggle-based design with comprehensive progress tracking

**Breaking Changes:**
None - all existing functionality preserved and enhanced.

**Migration Notes:**
Existing users can continue using Cruncher mode exactly as before. Combiner mode is a new addition that doesn't affect existing workflows.
